## Description
This application is a simple start for a social network that uses API so that a lot of different asynchronous data can be processed at ounce. 

## Motivation for Development
Wanting to create a social network that is fast and easy and does not require large amount of structure for ease of use. 

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Technologies Used: 
This application uses nosql, javascript, express.js, mongodb, mongoose and insomnia. 


## Challenges 
The first time I submitted it I accidently had all of my code committed out. That was not helpful. Also I had a hard time with the enum. I had also forgotten the link to github. 


## Successes
Fixing previous mistakes. 


## Directions for Future Development
Add more enum and also maybe some emojis.
